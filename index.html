	<h1>Michel Szklo</h1>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">I'm a first-year doctoral student in Public Administration and Government at <a href="http://eaesp.fgv.br/">Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o Getulio Vargas (EAESP FGV)</a>, research assistant at the <a href="http://cepesp.fgv.br/en">Center for Politics and Economics of the Public Sector</a>, and founder and executive director at <a href="http://lapp.org.br/">LAPP (Public Policy and Social Programs Lab)</a> -- a platform the seeks to gather, organize and provide in a straightforward fashion, information (causal evidence) on the impacts of public policy and social programs that went under rigorous evaluation worldwide. I also hold a bachelor's degree from the <a href="http://eesp.fgv.br/en">S&atilde;o Paulo School of Economics (EESP/FGV)</a> and a master's degree from <a href="https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/">Tilburg University</a>, all in economics.</p>
	<p style="text-align: justify;">I truly believe that evidence-based decision-making is the key to the development and strengthening of public policies and to positively&nbsp;impact the livelihoods of those who need the most. In my free time, I enjoy listening and playing music and cycling.</p>
