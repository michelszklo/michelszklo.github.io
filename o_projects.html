	<h3 style="padding-left: 15px;"><a href="http://lapp.org.br">LAPP</a></h3>
	<p style="padding-left: 30px;">LAPP is a platform that seeks to gather, organize and provide in a straightforward fashion, information (causal evidence) on the impacts of public policy and social programs that went under rigorous evaluation worldwide. </p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What problem are we solving?</span> Evidence-based decision-making is rarely the norm. We believe this is due to:</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">- disorganized and diffuse information: public policy and social programs impact evidence it is scattered around academic papers</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">- results are communicated in a complex manner: results are often presented in technical language, hampering the comprehension of the general public</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">With LAPP we hope to:</span></p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">- disseminate the culture of evidence-based decision-making</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">- incorporate reliable results into a democratic process of public reasoning</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">- contribute to the development and strengthening of public policies</p>
  <p style="padding-left: 30px;">- impact the livelihoods of those who need the most</p>
